                  <p class="boxp3">Some more street photography of Northampton. This time I brought a prism which sort of creates a double exposure effect. Overall, I love the edits and the outcome of these pictures. I feel like my colour-grading and editing has improved a lot, helping me showcase pictures that I wouldn't before.

                  <p class="boxp3">This is for the open day at De Montfort University. I took some pictures of the area, only had one hour to take photos around. I really like the area and the architecture there. Made up for some great shots.

                  <p class="boxp3 boxp16">This product photoshoot was really heavily dependent on Photoshop. I wanted to have my object on a dark background so, I grabbed a dark towel for this. I had two lamps as lighting from both sides, which will help with lighting up the liquid and not make it blend with the dark background. I then took the splashes and contrasted the background so I can then overlay it without any detail (didn't want the towel to appear in the splashes). I then used a red layer to apply it over the splashes and make it red through layer effects. I then cut out the product and warped the splash images around the bottle. I then added some red reflections to the bottle, added more colour to the splashes, and finally added a dust layer along with a flare and used layer effects to add some spice to the picture.

                  <p class="boxp3">In this photoshoot, I took some product photos. In the first image (MG_4051) I used Photoshop again to erase my hand from the picture. I really loved the background, and I thought it would complement the product, which it did. I also brought some props and used things around the area like sticks and leaves to fill in the blank space around the product and make it more interesting.

                  <p class="boxp3"> I feel like this photoshoot was extremely successful. I've used a lot of techniques and have used a lot of different styles in colour-grading and editing. I also like the range of categories I've shot. Products, cars, and landscapes. I am really happy with all the results I got from this photoshoot.

                  <p class="boxp3"> These pictures were taken in Harlestone firs, the same as in the first photoshoot. You can see the difference in the number of pictures taken. I also experimented with some Photoshop as well in this picture, not just Lightroom. In the image 'MG_2535' and 'MG_2534', I removed my friend's arm and the string that was attached to the camera. I really like the outcome. It looks like the camera is levitating. You can also see the immense improvement in editing versus my first photoshoot.

                  <p class="boxp3">Some photos taken in Northampton. I believe this is my greatest improvement in photography. I genuinely believe that composition is the most important thing in photography. There's a lot of photos that have turned out great. My editing and colour-grading were not the best here. However, I think the compositions are great.

                  <p class="boxp3">Some pictures I shot at the seaside in England. Just like the last photoshoot, I believe the pictures have great compositions but, there aren't that many great shots compared to the amount that I shot. However, this was a good thing. I was training my eye and started understanding what creates a good photo. I also think my editing was holding me back. Some of my old editing workflows didn't work on a lot of those well-composed pictures.

                  <p class="boxp3">These are some of the pictures I took while in France. I think I started experimenting with different editing styles and trying out new compositions. I still feel like I could've tried taking more pictuers even if they were bad. I think back then, I was only taking what I thought was a 'great' shot.

                  <p class="boxp3 boxp16">These are a few pictures I took at Durdle doors. These are all panoramas. I didn't have a wide-angle lens, and I knew they are the best for landscape photography. During this, the main thing I would change is planning. Usually, when people go to known landscapes, they mindlessly take pictures of the place. I think the best way to improve is by placing a subject in the scene or thinking of a better composition instead of including everything in the shot. One of the main reasons photographers don't like wide-angle lenses is because there's not as much creativity and thought when it comes to composition. Everything gets captured in the photo.

                  <p class="boxp3">These are just some images that I found interesting at the Warwick castle. I feel like I used to take so many shots without thinking about what I wanted. This might be a good thing because reviewing photos after photos that had no planning or subject in mind could have made me pay more attention for the next time. Now, when I want to take great photos, I continuously think about the next opportunity.

                  <p class="boxp3">This is the first and only time I went to London. My editing has improved, and I started creating more moody and cinematic looks on my photos. I feel like my compositions weren't the best and, I wasn't familiar with 'street photography' so, I took fewer shots than I would like to now. One other thing that I did wrong was setting the shutter speed to 1/5th of a second at night time. I never wanted to go over 500 ISO cause of quality. However, now I would rather use a maximum of 1600 ISO and a higher shutter speed than what I used back then.

                  <p class="boxp3">This is the first time I took photos with my DSLR while it was snowing. I tried to recreate MG_3185 from the previous photoshoot, and I like both results. I like the composition of those photos. MG_3346 is also great. I'm not sure if I was thinking about this when taking the image but, I like the leading lines in the snow and the trees following the background.

                  <p class="boxp3 boxp16">When I first got my DSLR, I wasn't thinking about how well it performed and wasn't too critical about the image quality. I watched a lot of videos on how to change settings, so I used manual settings from the start along with autofocus. Before getting my camera, I have watched a few videos on editing with Lightroom. I decided to get Lightroom and combine both tools to create better images. I used the radial tool a lot and changed the temperature to bring separation and contrast to the pictures, which I liked back then. MG_2386 is one of my best images back then. I used the rule of thirds as a technique to improve my photos. The image 'MG_3185' was taken in November. I started using other features from Lightroom and really started to learn the software as a whole. I was excited about this result, and even now, I think this is a pretty well shot and edited photo.

                  <p class="boxp3 boxp16">This whole website has taken a long time to create, and it is still incomplete. I'm sure there are a lot of bugs and areas I need to fix. I am also not entirely happy with the user interface and will probably change it in the future. This project has taught me a lot of new things, and it has been a lot of work. It has over 1600 files that have to be linked and anchored. I think with a little more planning, this could've taken way less by optimising how each file links to each other. However, I also don't believe the optimisation was too poor.

                  <p class="boxp3">For Digital technology, I had to pick using serif web plus to make a website or HTML and CSS. I thought that HTML and CSS would allow more freedom and help in future situations. The sign in website does not work, so you won't be signed up for anything.

                  <p class="boxp3">These are just some small projects I decided to create in Blender. There are a lot more, but these are a few that I could find. These take about one hour to five maximum and are pretty fun to make.

                  <p class="boxp3 boxp16">This project is something I always wanted to try. By using a course on Udemy, I was finally able to create a game. I used Photoshop and Unity with C#. The interesting part of this whole project is the fact that all graphics, which includes the characters and background of the game, were made by using a mouse and keyboard. Thanks to the feature 'smoothing' in Photoshop, I was able to create the main character, enemies, and the background of the game by using a mouse and not a drawing tablet. I do think a drawing tablet would have been way faster and more versatile.

                  <p class="boxp3">This project took so long to make. I used a lot of programs, mainly Blender. I used the audio from the ad One Ui 2.0 from Samsung. I thought the audio fitted pretty well with what I wanted to do. I had to create something similar, but with my Gig in mind. This project and House 2 probably took the longest to make.

                  <p class="boxp3">This time, I wanted to create a house as close as I could to a reference. This took a lot more time than my previous projects. I wanted to get it as close as possible, and therefore I needed to get the same angle and focal length of the camera, find similar textures create the same height and look. These blender projects are so much fun. Having a goal and seeing the improvements was really enjoyable.

                  <p class="boxp3">After creating the house project, I decided to try to create an interior. It took me around the same amount to make the interior as the exterior. I think the interior just had a lot more objects needed to make the scene look realistic. I also think the main issue in my House 1 Project was the fact that there wasn't enough detail, and there was a lot of blank space.

                  <p class="boxp3">This project took quite a while. One thing I did import for this project is the car. I wish I would've challenged myself and try to make a car. However, cars are difficult to create and it's only a small addition to the main image. I think for my skill level back then, this was quite a successful project.
